Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Indices (MYD13Q1) Version 6 data are generated every 16 days at 250 meter (m) spatial resolution as a Level 3 product. The MYD13Q1 product provides two primary vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over high biomass regions. The algorithm chooses the best available pixel value from all the acquisitions from the 16 day period. The criteria used is low clouds, low view angle, and the highest NDVI/EVI value.","license":"","properties":{"eo:gsd":250.0,"eo:bands":[{"name":"blue_reflectance","common_name":"blue","description":"Surface Reflectance Band

generated every 16 days at 250 meter (m) spatial resolution as a Level 3 product. The MYD13Q1 product provides two primary vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over high biomass regions. The algorithm chooses the best available pixel value from all the acquisitions from the 16 day period. The criteria used is low clouds, low view angle, and the highest NDVI/EVI value. Along with the vegetation layers and the two quality layers, the HDF file will have MODIS reflectance bands 1 (red), 2 (near-infrared), 3 (blue), and 7 (mid-infrared), as well as four observation layers.

This algorithm delivers the surface reflectance data from CBERS-4B Level-4 images. The methodology includes the integration of MODIS-MCD19A2 and VIIRS-EDR products as input atmospheric information (aerosol optical depth and water vapor). The results were evaluated using 616 Landsat-8 OLI surface reflectance imagery and AERONET data. These findings confirm that (i) CMPAC is a suitable tool for estimating surface reflectance of CBERS MUX data, and (ii) ancillary products support the application of atmospheric correction by filling the gap of atmospheric information.
